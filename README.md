This program is designed to be able to numerically calculate solvent-excluded surfaces of small and large molecules. It is being written for eventual integration with IQMol, a molecular builder and visualisation package written and maintained by Andrew Gilbert. This program is currently being written by Mitchell Blyth at the Australian National University, Canberra. It is designed to be open-source and free to use, pertaining to the license held by IQMol. Further information about IQMol can be found either elsewhere on GitHub, or at the website: http://iqmol.org
